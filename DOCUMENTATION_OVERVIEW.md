## 🎯 Specific Commands Explained

The Linux Commands Guide specifically addresses these commands you asked about:

```bash
sudo cp /usr/src/gtest/lib/*.a /usr/lib/
find /usr/src/gtest -name "*.a" 2>/dev/null
find /usr/src -name "*gtest*" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

**What the guide covers**:
- ✅ **Purpose** of each command in the Google Test installation context

## 🏗️ Clean Build System

The project now uses a **clean, separated build structure**:

```
build/
├── debug/          # Debug builds (with -g, no optimization)
├── release/        # Release builds (with -O3, LTO, etc.)
└── tests/          # Unit test artifacts
```

**Key Benefits**:
- ✅ No scattered `.o` files in source directories
- ✅ Easy to clean specific build types
- ✅ Source directories stay pristine
- ✅ Clear separation of debug vs release artifacts
- ✅ Future-proof for additional build types

**Build Commands**:
```bash
make debug      # Build debug version in build/debug/
make release    # Build optimized version in build/release/
make test       # Run unit tests (from tests/unit/ directory)
make clean      # Remove all build artifacts
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Read the Linux Commands Guide to understand the specific commands
2. **Short-term**: Work through the Unit Testing Guide to master testing concepts
3. **Long-term**: Use the Technical Report for continued raytracer development

The documentation suite provides a complete foundation for understanding both the specific project and the broader concepts of C++ development, testing, and Linux system administration.

*This documentation represents a complete learning path from basic Linux commands to advanced raytracer architecture, with practical examples and real-world applications throughout.*

## 🎯 Version Control Setup

**Professional `.gitignore` Configuration**:

```gitignore
# Clean build artifact exclusion
/build/                 # Entire build directory ignored
*.o                     # Object files anywhere  
raytracer              # Executables anywhere
test_runner            # Test executables
```

**What's Tracked** ✅:
- All source code (`src/`, `include/`)
- Documentation (`docs/*.typ`, `docs/*.pdf`)
- Build scripts (`Makefile`, `tests/unit/Makefile`)
- Project configuration files

**What's Ignored** ❌:
- All build artifacts (`build/debug/`, `build/release/`, `build/tests/`)
- Object files (`*.o`) anywhere in the project
- Executables (`raytracer`, `test_runner`)
- Development environment files (`.vscode/`, etc.)
- Temporary and backup files

**Benefits**:
- 🚀 Fast git operations (no large binaries)
- 👥 Team-friendly (no conflicts on build artifacts)
- 💾 Smaller repository size
- 🔄 Clean diffs focused on code changes
